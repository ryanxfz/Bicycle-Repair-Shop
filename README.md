# Bicycle Repair Shop
This app was developed as part of the *Human-Computer Interaction* module by **Thierry J.J. Ong** & **Ryan X.F.Zebua**. It provides an intuitive interface for bike service owners and customers to manage repair requests, order spare parts, and track service progress. For the shop owner, the app also streamlines financial tracking and inventory management.
